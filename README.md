The calculations were done in SQL.

These SQL files are where the calculations are done:

* [Initialize the Database](./src/createTheDatabase/initialize.sql)
* [Volume Based AADT Calculation](./src/calculations/volumeCalculations/createShortCountVolumeBasedAadtCalculationTables.sql)
* [Vehicle Classification Based Axle Factor Calculation](./src/calculations/classCalculations/classCountDatabaseViews.sql)

WARNING: This repo currently contains lots of dead code.
